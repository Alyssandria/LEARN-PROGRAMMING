# LEARNING JOURNEY

The goal of this repository is to store and document my journey upon learning multiple technologies

The plan is to learn 3 Major Programming Languages in the year of 2025.

Those 3 Programming Languages are:

- **C**
- **Python**
- **JavaScript**

## WHY C?

Because C is considered as the mother of all languages. I believe that learning C could benefit me tremendously and give me a solid foundation of programming in general. C is considered by many as a low level language because of the ability it provides the programmer access to memory.

These are the reasons why I'm picking C as my first language to learn.

## WHY PYTHON AND JAVASCRIPT?

I'm trying to learn both of these technologies because it's both popular and versatile. I believe that learning both of these could gain me an advantage in the ever competitive market. Both of these languages are high level programming languages making it relatively easy to learn.

## WHAT IS THE PLAN?

My approach currently is to learn these technologies thru practice. I'm trying to learn this by multiple mini activities/problems that gradually increases in complexity because after all, programming is just problem solving.

The activities in each of the language would be structured by "levels".

Each level would have 10 activities inside of them for me to solve. I will be using Chat GPT to create the activities for me. The structure of activities would look like this:

- **FUNDAMENTALS**
  - ...
- **INTERMEDIATE**
  - ...
- **ADVANCED**
  - ...

And in the end I would like to create a **simple programming language** or a simple shitty **compiler**. With this, I would also consider myself "done" with the language is when I feel like I'm comfortable with doing good programming practices("i.e What the language's "way" on doing things") and of course, implementing DSA's within that language.

My plan is to allocate 4 months on each of the languages because I only have a year to slack off. I know this journey is going to be tough but I believe that I will gain a lot from this journey not only in programming, but life in general.

Day 1 of my journey learning C would:

- Start on: **December 15, 2024**
- Deadline: **April 15, 2025**
